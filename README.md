This project involves time series analysis on stock prices, beginning with STL decomposition to separate the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components. A moving average was then applied to detrend the data for easier analysis. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted to ensure the data's stationarity. After confirming stationarity, the optimal ARIMA model was identified and fitted to the data for forecasting future prices. The model's performance was evaluated by plotting residuals to check for any remaining patterns or anomalies.
